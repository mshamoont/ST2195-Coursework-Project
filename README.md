Course Assignment 

This project is designed to analyze flight data using Python, SQL, and machine learning techniques such as logistic regression. The dataset, consisting of multiple CSV files, includes flight information like departure and arrival times, delays, diversions, and other flight-related features. The primary focus of the analysis is to explore the factors contributing to flight delays and diversions, applying machine learning models to gain insights and predictions.
